# An intro to metrics and dimensions

**Metrics** and **Dimensions** are defined in your semantic layer. They are the building blocks for all queries and visuals you’ll create in Lightdash.

- **Dimensions** are used to segment data in your Tables. [Learn more and see examples](/references/dimensions/).
- **Metrics** are used to perform calculations on your Tables. [Learn more and see examples](/references/metrics).

For example, let’s say we want **Unique Customers** and **Total Revenue** grouped by **Month** and **Order Status**. 

- The data is being segmented by **Month** and **Order Status**, so those are the **dimensions**.
- **Unique Customers** and **Total Revenue** will both need to be calculated from individual order totals and by counting unique customers, so they are **metrics**.

Here’s the same question represented in SQL:

```sql
select 
	order_month,
	order_status,
	count(distinct customer_id) as unique_customers,
	sum(order_total) as total_revenue
from orders
group by 1,2
```

In the query, `order_month` and `order_status` are **dimensions**, and the columns that use aggregations (`unique_customers` and `total_revenue`) are **metrics**.
